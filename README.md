# Bank_Management_System
##Bank Management System in C++
#Overview
This C++ project uses bank management system using AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree data structure to complete well-managed data. The system provides continuous solutions using data processing to store and store information.

#Features
AVL Tree: This project uses an AVL tree to manage parallel structures and enable efficient search, insertion and retrieval operations. lay off.

File processing: Data is constantly stored in the file, which allows the system to retain data even after the program is closed.

#Requirements
C++ Compiler (supports C++11 or later)
Any standard C++ IDE (optional)

#How to use
Follow the on-screen instructions to run the program.
Perform account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry and other transactions.

#Sample file
main.cpp: Contains the content of the program.
file_handling.h: header file of file handling.
customer.h: Header file that defines the customer account model.
Transaction.h: header file that defines transactions related to transactions.

#Future improvements
Use additional functions such as converting numbers and generating reports.
Cure errors and valid entries.
Optimize code datasets for large code.
